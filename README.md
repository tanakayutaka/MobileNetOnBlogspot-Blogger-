# MobileNetOnBlogspot-Blogger-
Simple Cut &amp; Paste code to have MobileNetOnBlogspot(Blogger)

Google Blogger(Blogspot) is free and we should more make use of if possible. 

I somehow wanted to have some AI related apps on Blogger and found MobileNet but it was mostly presented in web server basis. 

I googled around but could not find direct sample. 

Hence I did it myself by the use of 'parent' method. 

I am new to Javascript, hence what I wrote and made here can be just a common sense to many already.

However for those who are new like myself and struggling for the implementation, I put article here. 

Pls refer to below link to see demo
