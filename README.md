# MobileNetOnBlogspot-Blogger-

Simple Cut &amp; Paste code to have MobileNet on Blogspot(Blogger).

Google Blogger(Blogspot) is free and we should more make use of if possible. 

I somehow wanted to have some AI related apps on Blogger and found MobileNet but it was always presented in web server basis. 

I googled around but could not find direct sample where whole scripts are packed together in on HTML.

Hence I did it myself by the use of 'parent' method. 

I am new to Javascript, hence what I wrote and made here can be just a common sense to many already.

However for those who are new Javascript like myself and are struggling for the implementation, this article can be helpful. 

Pls refer to below link to see demo.
